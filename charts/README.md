## Deploy on Kubernetes

_Note: this deployment requires an existing Amazon EKS cluster. Instructions below show how to create the cluster, but many configurations options are available and show be reviewed._

See the instructions in [k8s deployment](../docs/source/kubernetes_deployment.rst) or in the [readthedocs](https://seed-platform.readthedocs.io/en/stable/kubernetes_deployment.html). The instructions in readthedocs may be slightly behind the other documentation.
