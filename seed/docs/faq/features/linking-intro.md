Cross-cycle linking, or simply **linking**, allows organizations to analyze uploads of the same property (or tax lot) over time. This is done by matching records in one cycle with records within other cycles. SEED builds these associations automatically during import using matching criteria as specified by the organization. Additionally, this association can be made during a manual edit to record values (especially if the changed value is a matching criteria field).

For even more details on matching and linking, refer to [this section of the matching, merging, and linking documentation](https://github.com/SEED-platform/seed/blob/develop/docs/source/matching.rst#linking-across-cycles).
