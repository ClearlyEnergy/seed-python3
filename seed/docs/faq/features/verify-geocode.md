question: I just geocoded my data using SEED. How do I review and verify the results?

There are multiple ways of verifying geocoding results. The most obvious way is to verify that latitude and longitude fields are populated. Additionally, SEED provides a field called "Geocoding Confidence". This field can provide evidence of how the geocoding went for that record - a value starting with "Low..." indicates that geocoding failed for a record because the address values didn't yield reliable results. Finally, SEED provides an inventory map page that allows you to view where the points are located on a map.
